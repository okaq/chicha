Machi is the okaq.com block pixel drawing tool.
Similar in nature to a favicon generator, Machi 
works as a web app that can export images.

Workflow:
Set number of blocks in a square (eg 8x8).
Set square size of brush tool (eg 1x1).
Pick color from HSLA color sliders.
Snap to grid during hover over grid.
Click (mousedown) to fill block area.
Erase fill area using eraser tool.
Save to cloud with alphanumeric name.
Export to JSON file consisting of a single
array of CSS3 HSLA colors.

GIFS:
The GIF file format, although portable
and compact, leaves a lot to be desired.
A client side GIF generator is possible
provided we can fill a JS buffer and 
render it to an <img> on the page.
Probably using an data image URI.
This is preferable to a roundtrip
to the server to use giflib(node-gif)
to encode the image which is CPU
intensive and involves a disk write.
Conclusion: keep it JSON, canvas,
and avoid GIFs altogether.

by choosing field size (2^N) and brush size.

erase, frames, new frame, render.
3. Render - edit, save.
